# 🌊 Rising Waters – AI-Based Flood Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

Rising Waters is an AI-powered Flood Prediction System developed using Machine Learning and Flask. The application predicts whether an area is at **High Flood Risk** or **Low Flood Risk** based on environmental and geographical factors. The system uses an XGBoost classifier trained on historical flood-related data to provide accurate flood risk predictions along with confidence scores.
